Machine Learning Projects

This repository contains multiple machine learning projects implemented using Python and Jupyter Notebooks. Each project demonstrates practical applications of ML algorithms, data processing, and predictive modeling.

Projects Included

Gold Price Prediction

Predicting gold prices using regression models.

Techniques: Data preprocessing, feature engineering, regression algorithms.

Resume ATS Scoring System (RESUME_ATS)

An automated system to analyze resumes and provide an ATS (Applicant Tracking System) score.

Techniques: NLP, scikit-learn, document parsing (pdfplumber, python-docx, PyMuPDF).

(Add any additional projects here if present in the repo.)

Installation

Clone the repository:

git clone https://github.com/dharunS05/Machine_Learning.git
cd Machine_Learning


Create a virtual environment (recommended):

python -m venv env
source env/bin/activate  # Linux/macOS
env\Scripts\activate     # Windows


Install dependencies:

pip install -r requirements.txt

Usage

Open the Jupyter Notebooks for each project and run the cells step by step.

Modify datasets or parameters to experiment with predictions and results.

For the Resume ATS project, upload resumes in supported formats (.pdf, .docx) to see the ATS scoring.

Technologies Used

Python 3.x

Jupyter Notebook

Libraries: pandas, numpy, scikit-learn, nltk, spacy, xgboost, pdfplumber, python-docx, PyMuPDF, sentence-transformers
